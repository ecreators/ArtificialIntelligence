#Artificial Intelligent (Projekt)

**Author**: _Bj√∂rn Frohberg_, Software-Developer, Germany, bf2782@web.de

## Introduction

### Goals

This project shows how a neural network work and how to use it, will be
descripted in this documentation.

&check; Create neural network library projekt <br/>
&check; Create the project for JAVA 1.8 <br/>
&check; Begin documentation <br/>
* Create a neural network (nn) type
* Create a nn layer type
* Create a nn layer neuron
* Create a nn layer neuron binding
* Make the neural network saveable to be restorable
* Make the neural network restorable from load
* Create a test to do a smoke testing on the nn

### Mechanics

**Task** Neural Network (nn) : Type

######_Business Value_
We need a handler to do operations representing the neural network.

######_Requirements_
This are operations the nn must have
* prepare the neural network with layers and their neurons
* test given inputs and return predicted output values therefore
* train the neural network, by using test with a learning gradient <br/>
* implement a routine to use Training Session plus amount of iterations (generations) to use train operations on each Training unit
* make the training based on a Training Session
* make a Training Session contain Training Units
* make a Training Unit contain input values and desired / expected output values

<pre><code></code></pre>

**Task** Training Unit : Type

######_Business Value_
For a training session I need a Training Unit (type) to enlist training definitions.

######_Requirements_
* input values : array of floating numbers
* desired / expected output values : array of floating numbers

<pre><code></code></pre>

**Task** Training Session : Type

######_Business Value_
To be able to define a readable training we collect Training Units into a Training Session to
contain some training data and results.

######_Requirements_
* Training Units as array
* Learning Gradient : floating number between 0 and 1 (but not 0 or 1)

<pre><code></code></pre>

**Task** Binding : Type

######_Business Value_
A Neuron (type) requires input data to sum and balance. This balancing value is a floating number.
Initial it must be a weight number greater or smaller than zero. But for use there is reason
to set it initial randomly between this numbers. To balance one input value we need a binding, having
at least an input neuron and a balancing property.

######_Requirements_
* input neuron as property
* balancing value as floating number property

<pre><code></code></pre>

**Task** Neuron : Type

######_Business Value_
A Neuron (type) is a unit to represent a solution for an output value and bindings to input neurons.
This bindings are nessessary to propergate input values to child neurons.
A neuron is a heart of the neuron network, it does some operations for us, but every neuron
does it the same way.

######_Requirements_
A neuron has two main operations
* calculate a new trigger value for following connected neurons in a child layer of the neural network and propagate it forward
* calculate new balancing values in input bindings based on correction delta coming propagted from a child layer neuron and propapate it back

This is the hardest part and requires further informations in a separated section of this documentation.

**Task** Layer : Type

######_Business Value_
A Layer (type) is a container for listed neurons.
It has a delegating purpose. It delegate operations through all it holding neurons.

######_Requirements_
A layer requires an listing for neurons and their creation operation.
I want to encapsule operations based on it used types, so it is easy to understand,
what this unit (layer : type) must be able to do.
